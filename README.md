# JANGL-alien-shooter

This is a game where you defeat waves of aliens (the texture doesn't look like an alien, but come on, you have to call them something).

Waves spawn periodically. The wave size and enemy speed increases exponentially per wave.

## Support

Since macOS does not support OpenGL versions after 4.1, this game is not supported for macOS.

## Compiling

To run the project from the source code, first add the `libs` file as a dependency ([IntelliJ guide here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/library.html)). Then, run the `Main` class.
