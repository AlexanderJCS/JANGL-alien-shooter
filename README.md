# JANGL-alien-shooter

This is a game where you defeat waves of aliens.

Waves spawn periodically. The wave size and enemy speed increases exponentially per wave.

## Made with JANGL

This project is made with my graphics library, JANGL. See more information [here](https://github.com/AlexanderJCS/JANGL).

## Support

Since macOS does not support OpenGL versions after 4.1, this game is not supported for macOS.

## Compiling

To run the project from the source code, first add the `libs` file as a dependency ([IntelliJ guide here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/library.html)). Then, run the `Main` class.
